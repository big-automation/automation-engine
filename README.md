# Welcome to Automation-Test-Engine (ATE)

Automation-Test-Engine (ATE) is an engine to parse and execute test case(s) driven by key words or AI machine learning powered web element recognizer.

Current verion of ATE is an open source tool built on top of Selenium for system level testing, NOT for developer unit testing. 

It's the first tool that has solved the conflict of easy-to-use vs. code maintainability, which exists in most of the system QA automation tools on the market including QTP, Functional Tester and Test Complete, etc. It's very common for those tools' users to deal with the difficulty of choosing between recording (easy-to-use) and heavy programming (high level coding skills needed) strategies. 

Now, with ATE, this world suddenly becomes simple and easy for everyone. QA team could easily convert every manual QA tester to automation QA tester.

ATE User Quick Start manual should be enough for manual QA tester to start from without any specfic training. Time needed to run first test case is less than the duration of getting familar with a smart TV.

If needed, only minimal training will help to be capable of using this tool. The training shall have the following knowledge,
* HTML, which has already been possessed by most manual QA testers
* Understand and create XML file.

ATE automation testers don't need any programming or domain specific language skills to use this tool.

ATE's design and source code are also a perfect study material for application programming in Java. Design has touched almost every aspects of java tactical technologies popularly used in the application development projects. These technologies including Spring, Log4j/Logback, JPA, Data management, TestNG, Jenkins, AOP, IOC/DI. On-going modules will include RESTFul, SOAP, Graph database, Andoid and Apple Mobile development etc. 

Contributor of ATE project will learn the most popular automation testing tool, Selenium, which is creating jobs doubled as many as QTP.

NOTE2: Current version ATE only supports web application testing. Future version could integrate with other native application testing tools.
