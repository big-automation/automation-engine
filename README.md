Welcome to Automation-Test-Engine (ATE)
======================
ATE is an engine to parse and execute test case(s) written in Spring application context xml file format.

It's an open source tool built on top of Selenium for system level (end2end) QA regression testing, NOT for developer unit testing. 

It's the first tool that has solved the conflict of easy-to-use vs. code maintainability, which exists in most of the system QA automation tools on the market including QTP, Functional Tester and Test Complete, etc.

User manual is supposed to be enough for manual QA tester to start from without any specfic training. 

If needed, manual QA tester needs only minimal training to be capable of using this tool. The training shall have the following knowledge,
* HTML tag, which has already been possessed by most manual QA testers
* Minimal SQL statements, which have been possessed by most manual QA testers
* Understand Spring Application Context xml file format, 2-3 hour's training session.
* ATE environment introduction, 1-2 hour's training session.

ATE automation testers don't need any programming or domain specific language skills to use this tool.

ATE's design and source code are also a good study material for application programming in Java. Design has touched almost every aspects of java tactical technologies popularly used in the application development projects. These technologies including Spring, Log4j/Logback, JPA, Data management, TestNG, Jenkins, AOP, IOC/DI. On-going modules will include RESTFul, SOAP, Graph database, Andoid and Apple Mobile development etc.
